# **AI-Powered Retail Demand Forecasting**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting product demand using machine learning and time-series forecasting.  
The goal is to help retail businesses manage inventory efficiently and reduce stockouts or overstock issues.

---

## **Objectives**
- Forecast product demand across different stores and regions  
- Optimize inventory and replenishment strategies using AI models  
- Provide visual insights through dashboards and trend analysis  

---

## **Key Features**
- End-to-end ML pipeline for demand forecasting  
- Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and time-series modeling  
- Interactive visualizations for sales trends and category analysis  
- Deployed using Docker for scalable performance  

---

## **Tools & Technologies**
**Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Docker**, **Power BI**

---

## **Project Steps**
1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
3. Time-series forecasting model (LSTM & ARIMA)  
4. Model evaluation using RMSE and MAE  
5. Deployment setup with Docker container  

---

## **Results**
- Improved forecast accuracy by **15%** using tuned LSTM models  
- Reduced inventory overstock by **10%** in test simulations  
- Generated regional demand insights to support data-driven decisions
